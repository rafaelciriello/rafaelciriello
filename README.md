# 👋 Hi, I'm Rafael Ciriello!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **DevOps and Cloud enthusiast** transitioning into tech, with a passion for automation, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable infrastructure. I'm actively building skills in **AWS**, **Terraform**, **Docker**, **Git**, and **Linux**, preparing for certifications like **AWS Certified Developer Associate** and **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate**. My goal is to land a **Junior DevOps Engineer** role in the UK, contributing to innovative cloud projects. ☕

## 🚀 About Me
- 💻 **Professional Focus**: Crafting CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Cloud automation with tools like AWS, Terraform, and GitHub Actions.
- 📚 **Currently Learning**: Deepening expertise in **AWS** (EC2, S3, Lambda), **Terraform** for IaC, **Python/Boto3** for automation, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes** basics.
- 🎯 **Goal**: Deliver value to DevOps teams through efficient automation, robust version control, and cloud best practices.
- 🧠 **Background**: Bringing problem-solving and analytical skills from a non-tech background, with hands-on experience in AWS Free Tier labs (EC2, S3, VPC).
